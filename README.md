# Html-CSS
### This program is to learn html and css and later on add javascript to it. 

# Websites listed/Roadmap:
 1. About Me Site/Portfolio
 2. Dragon Ball Fighterz Resource site
 3. Western Canada DragonBall site?
 4. Marvel vs Capcom 2 Resource site

**Note**: I don't have a timeline for these sites and they are mostly ideas, I'll try to start them depending on how comfortable I feel with HTML, CSS and eventually Javascript.
